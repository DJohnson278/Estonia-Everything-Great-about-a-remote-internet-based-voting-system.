First of all, I strongly believe that democracy is the greatest form of government. Absolute power always corrupts, so dividing the power among the people is the greatest possible method of preventing corruption.
Secondly, having people go to specific places to vote is a little outdated, so having people vote on their smartphones, which they already use on a day-to-day basis, makes the most sense.
The Internet is an amazing thing, where ideas can be shared instantaniously. Why not use this system to vote?
