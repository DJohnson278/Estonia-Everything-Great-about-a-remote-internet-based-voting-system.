<p>First of all, I strongly believe that democracy is the greatest form of government. Absolute power always corrupts, so dividing the power 
  among the people is the greatest possible method of preventing corruption.</p>

<p>Secondly, having people go to specific places to vote is a little outdated, so having people vote on their smartphones, which they already 
use on a day-to-day basis, makes the most sense. The Internet is an amazing place, where people can communicate from opposite sides of the 
  globe, so why not use this system to vote?</p>
